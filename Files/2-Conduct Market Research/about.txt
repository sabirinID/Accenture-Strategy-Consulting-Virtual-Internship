	What you'll do

# Here is the background information on your task
Welcome back to the Accenture UK Consulting Foundations Virtual Programme! In this task, you will be conducting important market research to help Everqlo make an informed business decision.

Everqlo’s new Director for E-commerce was approached by a major Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) provider to offer their services.

Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) is a form of point-of-sale credit that allows consumers to defer their purchase payment either through interest-free instalments (e.g. pay in 4 instalments) or after a certain interest-free period (e.g. pay in 30 or 60 days).

While a form of credit, BNPL has been growing in popularity as a payment option with online shoppers, and this trend was further accelerated by a pandemic-driven surge in e-commerce volumes.

Everqlo’s current payment options on their website include credit/debit card payment and Apple Pay.

Everqlo’s Director of E-commerce is interested in offering BNPL and asked Accenture to provide their recommendation on whether it is worth exploring the BNPL option for their e-commerce store.

# Here is your task
Your task is to read through various materials & reports provided by your Accenture project lead and prepare an email to Everqlo’s Director of E-commerce, John Morgan, with a recommendation on whether Everqlo should explore offering a BNPL option on their e-commerce site.

Think about how the BNPL payment option might impact some of the revenue drivers you identified in task 1 and be sure to include them in your recommendation.

Submit your email in the text submission box below.
