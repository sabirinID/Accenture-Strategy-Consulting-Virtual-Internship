Task 5: Analyse Data from Project Launch
From analysis to insight.

# Task Overview
	What you'll learn
		How to combine and analyse different behavioural and customer data points to uncover detailed insights 

	What you'll do
		Analyse order data to understand the early impact of BNPL on their overall customer experience
		Develop a PowerPoint slide to communicate your insights

# Here is the background information on your task
Welcome back to the Accenture UK Consulting Foundations Virtual Experience Programme! After several months of working closely with Accenture, Everqlo has implemented a Buy Now Pay Later solution into their e-commerce store.

They have piloted the new payment option with a subset of their customers and now want us to deliver a short summary of the results.While the pilot has been in operation for a relatively short period of time, Everqlo leadership is really keen to understand the early impact of BNPL on their overall customer experience.

Fortunately, the wealth of analytics tools allows us to capture enormous amounts of data about users’ shopping behaviour and patterns when using digital websites and apps.

Combining and analysing different behavioural and customer data points (such as age, gender, location) can help uncover detailed and accurate insights into customer’s overall experience as well as guide Everqlo’s business and technical teams as to how to improve that experience for customers.

And that is exactly what your Accenture team lead asked you to focus on for this task: analyse shopper order data from Everqlo’s e-commerce site and draw interesting insights.  

Specifically, they want you to answer the following:

	What age group used BNPL option most?
	What is the share of transaction amount that BNPL accounted for?
	What is the average age of a customer that used a BNPL option?

# Here is your task
Part 1

	Download the Excel file provided in additional materials. The dataset contains order data from Everqlo’s e-commerce system. 
	Create one or more pivot tables for each question posed by the client
	To create age groups, use the following grouping settings: min.value = 18, max value = 50, interval size = 5

Part 2

	Using the data and pivot tables you have created in Part 1 and a PowerPoint slide template provided, create a bar chart that shows the share of BNPL transactions as a percentage of total transactions for each age group
	Your slide should have the following:
		A key observation/message, that can be understood without looking at the chart or comments
		A bar chart showing a bar per each age group (same groups as in Part 1) with a percentage of BNPL transactions for that age group, not total for every customer
		1-2 additional comments that support key observations or describe data in more detail.

“Why are you interested in this role?”
I recently participated in Accenture UK's virtual job simulation on the Forage platform, and it was incredibly useful to understand what it might be like to work as a consultant at Accenture UK.
I worked on a project to implement a Buy Now Pay Later option for an e-commerce client. I practiced stakeholder management, strategic thinking, analytical thinking, decision-making, data interpretation as well as user experience and process design skills in a real-world context.
Doing this program confirmed that I really enjoy working on complex client initiatives and I’m excited to apply these skills on a consulting team at a company like Accenture UK.
