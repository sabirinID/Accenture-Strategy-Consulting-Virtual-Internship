	What you'll do

# Here is the background information on your task
Welcome back to the Accenture UK Consulting Foundations Programme!

In the previous task, you conducted market research by reading through various materials and reports, and wrote out an email with recommendations to Everqlo on creating a BNPL option. Next, we're going to dive into the customer journey, and visualize how the BNPL option will impact the customer journey at Everqlo’s e-commerce channel.

User journeys, on a high level, describe a set of steps a user takes when interacting with a digital (or non--digital) product or service. User journey documents can include varying levels of detail and different types of information: high level user steps, touchpoints a user interacts with during their experience (e.g. a mobile app, and a retail store), user pain points at various steps of the journey, and other elements.

User journeys can also be included in larger product or service blueprints, which describe not only the user-related aspects of the product or service, but also internal company processes required to support the service, as well as technology infrastructure related to that.

User journey mapping process usually involves first describing the As Is journey, i.e. how users currently interact with a product / service, and a To Be journey, which visualises how the user will interact with the product in future, after the journey has been improved/redesigned.

Everqlo’s E-commerce team has provided you with their current high level As Is process for their current e-commerce buying journey. Your task is to analyse the As Is journey, think about how a BNPL option will fit into the user experience and visualise the To Be user journey, that involves the new BNPL option.

The client has asked you to provide a high-level journey of key user steps, so there is no need to go into the details related to pain points, tech infrastructure or other aspects.
